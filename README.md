### Hi👋, I'm Nazareth Villar

I'm a FullStack developer from Argentina 🙌.

🔭✨ I'm currently focused on web development projects, but I'm always looking for new challenges that allow me to expand my knowledge and skills in different areas.

🤝👯I love to learn and constantly improve myself, so I'm always open to new ideas and collaboration proposals.
